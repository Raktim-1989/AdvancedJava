This test is very useful for cross validation between front-end webpage with back-end API

In an web-page , if there is a webtable , where using .getText() we will retrieve the content // i.e.e appium 
now, in back end , we will be having one input JSON , using a URL, we will get a response

now from that API response, we will do the following --->>>
convert that response JSON into Java objects and using getter & setter methods , we will retrieve the values

then compare this back-end data with front end selenium values !!
